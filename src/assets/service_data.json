    "full_details": "based on the traditional Pilates exercises, these classes are functional, building on better posture and mobility. Exercises are done both standing and on the floor. They are slow and controlled and target all areas of the body but particularly the core (stomach, back and bottom). Many different types of stretches are included and there are progressions offered for exercises to allow a mixed group of people to take part and work at their own level. They are classes that also help focus the mind and make you concentrate on yourself and can help you improve your mental health. We have different levels of class to suit participants better and to assist with mental health we have a short stretch and relax at the end of each Pilates session.",

    "full_details": "These classes are done using light hand weights or resistance bands. They are both standing and floor-based. They give an increased heart rate but without any impact thus improving cardiovascular fitness. The resistance of the weights and the bands can help improve muscle strength and tone without building muscle, maintain flexibility and balance, improve bone strength and help with weight management. Very suitable for those who want a bit more. We also offer some faster resistance classes incorporating cardio exercises.",

Our personal trainers are certified by some of India's top teacher training institutes and can help you train for strength, flexibility, balance, and body-mind awareness. You dont have to be flexible to do yoga. Yoga has many variations in every pose and a good teacher can help you do modifications of yoga poses that take your own level of flexibility into account.",
